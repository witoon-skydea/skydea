3. **API Routes**
   - Created comprehensive REST API for trips, places, and itinerary items
   - Added Google Maps API integration for place search
   - Implemented validation and error handling

4. **Frontend UI**
   - Created trip planner view with tabs for Overview, Places, Itinerary, and Map
   - Implemented modals for creating and editing data
   - Designed responsive UI that works on mobile and desktop

5. **Google Maps Integration**
   - Added place search using Google Places API
   - Implemented interactive map for visualization
   - Created route visualization for daily itineraries

6. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**
   - Implemented drag-and-drop for reordering itinerary items
   - Created backend API for saving the new order

7. **Enhanced Error Handling and Validation**
   - Added validation middleware for all user inputs
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling
   - Created user-friendly error messages

8. **Documentation**
   - Updated README with new features
   - Created comprehensive TRIP_PLANNER.md documentation
   - Added implementation notes

## Pending Tasks

1. **Google Maps API Key**
   - Need to obtain a valid Google Maps API key for production use
   - Configure API key restrictions for security

2. **Testing**
   - Test the application in standalone mode (Base Path is /)
   - Test the application under a configured sub-path (e.g., /skydea)

3. **Security Enhancements**
   - Consider rate limiting for API routes
   - Add more input validation and sanitization
   - Review CSRF protection

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Consider pagination for large lists of places
   - Optimize database queries for performance
   - Implement lazy loading for map markers

5. **Additional Features**
   - Weather integration for trip days
   - Trip sharing capabilities
   - Export itineraries to PDF/print format
   - Integration with calendar applications
   - Trip cost tracking functionality

## Next Steps

1. **Google Maps API Key Setup**
   - Create a Google Cloud project
   - Enable required APIs (Maps JavaScript API, Places API)
   - Generate and restrict API key
   - Add key to .env file

2. **Testing Plan**
   - Create test scenarios for all CRUD operations
   - Test drag-and-drop functionality across browsers
   - Verify mobile responsiveness and interactions
   - Validate subpath configuration works with the trip planner

3. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Update deployment scripts if needed
   - Test on staging environment
   - Prepare production environment variables

## Notes for Maintenance

- The Google Maps integration requires ongoing API key management
- Monitor Google Maps API usage to avoid unexpected charges
- Consider caching frequently accessed places data
- The trip planner uses client-side JavaScript heavily, so keep browser compatibility in mind for future updates
