# Skydea Trip Planner Bug Fix Summary

## Bug Description
Trip planner page would get stuck in loading state when trying to load places data. The loading indicator would display indefinitely, although the PDF export functionality still worked properly.

## Root Causes
1. **Inconsistent Base Path Handling**: 
   - The application uses a basePath configuration for reverse proxy support, but the API URL construction was inconsistent.
   - Multiple components had their own way of building URLs, creating conflicts.

2. **Route Registration Conflicts**:
   - The same route handlers were used for both web and API routes, creating confusion in routing logic.

3. **Path Normalization Issues**:
   - Path normalization wasn't handled consistently when building API URLs.

4. **Script Loading Order**:
   - The path utility functions weren't always available when needed.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed the Trip Planner JS Script
- Modified `trip-planner.js` to use the PathUtil functions properly
- Added fallback mechanisms for building API URLs in case PathUtil isn't available
- Added additional logging to help diagnose issues

### 2. Created a Fix Script
- Created a new `fix-trips.js` script that:
  - Proactively fixes paths when the page loads
  - Intercepts the loading process if it's stuck
  - Manually fetches place data if needed using the correct URL format
  - Provides better error messages for the user

### 3. Fixed Server Routes
- Modified `server.js` to prevent route conflict
- Used separate router instances for API routes to avoid cross-contamination of middleware
- Added additional logging for route registration

### 4. Improved Script Loading Order
- Updated script loading order in `trips/planner.ejs` to ensure path utilities load first
- Added the fix script immediately after path utilities

## Testing Requirements
This fix should be tested in two environments:
1. **Standalone mode**: Where basePath is '/'
2. **Sub-path mode**: With basePath set to any non-root path (e.g., '/skydea/')

## Potential Future Improvements
1. Implement a unified URL management system to avoid path construction in multiple places
2. Add more comprehensive API error handling
3. Create a more robust script loading system with dependency management
4. Add automatic retry logic for failed API requests
